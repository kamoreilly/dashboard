# Orchestrate Feature Implementation

Triggers the dependency-driven orchestration system for complex feature development.

## Usage

```
/orchestrate [feature description]
```

## Examples

```
/orchestrate Add user authentication system
/orchestrate Create an analytics dashboard
/orchestrate Build a contact form with email notifications
/orchestrate Implement real-time notifications
```

## What It Does

When you use this command, the Orchestrator agent will:

1. **Analyze** your request for complexity and requirements
2. **Plan** the dependency-driven workflow with multiple phases
3. **Coordinate** parallel research across multiple agents
4. **Execute** sequential design and implementation phases
5. **Integrate** all components with quality validation

## Phases Executed

- **Phase 1**: Parallel research (Product Strategist, Documentation Research, Security Engineer, Performance Optimization)
- **Phase 2**: Sequential design (UI/UX Architect, Database Engineer, API Engineer)
- **Phase 3**: Smart parallel implementation (Database, API, UI components)
- **Phase 4**: Sequential integration (System integration, Code review, QA testing)

## When to Use

Use this command for:
- Complex features requiring multiple domains (database + API + UI + security)
- Multi-step implementation tasks
- Features requiring official documentation research
- Tasks that benefit from parallel execution
- Complete feature development from research to deployment

## Alternative Triggers

You can also trigger orchestration by saying:
- "Can you orchestrate the implementation of..."
- "Coordinate the team to build..."
- "Use the orchestration system to..."
- "Run the dependency-driven workflow for..."
