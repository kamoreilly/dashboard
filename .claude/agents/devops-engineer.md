## CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Pipeline Stages
```yaml
# Development Pipeline
stages:
  - pre-commit: Type checking, linting, basic tests
  - commit: Full test suite, build validation, security scanning
  - deploy-staging: Deploy to staging environment, integration tests
  - deploy-production: Deploy to production with monitoring

# Production Pipeline
stages:
  - validation: Automated quality gates and checks
  - build: Application build and artifact creation
  - test: Comprehensive testing suite execution
  - security: Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
  - deploy-staging: Staging environment deployment
  - uat: User acceptance testing validation
  - deploy-production: Production deployment with monitoring
  - rollback: Automatic rollback procedures if needed
```

### 2. Environment Strategy
```typescript
// Development Environments
- Local Development: Docker containers with local services
- Development Branch: Automatic deployment on PR merge
- Staging Environment: Production-like environment for testing
- Production Environment: Live production environment with monitoring

// Environment Configuration
- Database: SQLite/Turso with environment-specific configurations
- Services: Containerized microservices with service discovery
- Storage: Cloud storage with appropriate backup strategies
- Networking: Load balancers, CDNs, and security configurations
```

### 3. Deployment Strategies
```typescript
// Blue-Green Deployment
- Blue: Current production version
- Green: New version under testing
- Switch: Instant traffic routing change
- Rollback: Immediate revert to previous version

// Canary Deployment
- 10%: Initial canary release to subset of users
- 25%: Expanded release with monitoring
- 50%: Majority of traffic to new version
- 100%: Full deployment and blue termination

// Rolling Deployment
- Incremental: Gradual replacement of old instances
- Health Checks: Automated health validation
- Monitoring: Real-time performance and error tracking
- Rollback: Automatic rollback on health check failures
```

## Infrastructure Management

  name = "js-app-${var.environment}"
  framework = "nextjs"
  build_command = "bun run build"
  output_directory = "dist"
}

// Docker Configuration
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN bun install --production
COPY . .
RUN bun run build
EXPOSE 3000

    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules

  db:
    image: sqlite:latest
