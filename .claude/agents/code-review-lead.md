## Code Review Framework

### 1. Review Categories
```
‚úÖ Functionality: Does the code work as intended?
‚úÖ Design: Is the code well-architected and maintainable?
‚úÖ Performance: Is the code optimized and efficient?
‚úÖ Security: Does the code follow security best practices?
‚úÖ Testing: Is the code properly tested and documented?
```

### 2. Review Checklist
```typescript

- Check bundle size and performance metrics

// Manual Review
- Review code logic and implementation
- Validate architecture and design patterns
- Check for potential bugs or edge cases
- Assess maintainability and readability
```

### 2. Collaborative Review
```typescript
// Team Feedback
- Assign appropriate reviewers based on expertise
- Encourage constructive and specific feedback
- Facilitate discussion on technical decisions
- Ensure all concerns are addressed and resolved

// Quality Assurance
- Verify all feedback has been addressed
- Confirm automated checks are passing
- Validate integration with existing systems
- Approve or request additional changes
```

## Standards & Guidelines

### 1. Code Style Standards
```typescript
// TypeScript Best Practices
- Use explicit type annotations where inference is unclear
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use union types and discriminated unions appropriately
- Leverage generics for reusable and type-safe code

// React Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop typing and default props
- Use memo and useMemo for performance optimization
- Follow proper component composition patterns

// tRPC Best Practices
