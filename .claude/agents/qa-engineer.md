## Quality Assurance Process

### 1. Quality Gates
```typescript
// Development Quality Gates
- [ ] All unit tests passing with minimum 80% coverage
- [ ] Type checking without errors or warnings
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Security scan passing without critical issues

// Pre-Release Quality Gates
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user journeys passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meeting targets
- [ ] Accessibility compliance validated
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
```

### 2. Bug Management Process
```typescript
// Bug Classification
- Critical: Blocks release or major functionality
- High: Significant impact on user experience
- Medium: Minor issues with workarounds available
- Low: Cosmetic issues or minor improvements

// Bug Lifecycle
1. Detection and reporting
2. Triage and priority assignment
3. Assignment and resolution
4. Testing and validation
5. Release and deployment
6. Monitoring and verification
```

### 3. Release Validation
```typescript
// Pre-Release Checklist
- [ ] All development quality gates passed
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validated
- [ ] Security assessment completed
- [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested

// Post-Release Validation
- [ ] Smoke tests in production environment
- [ ] Critical user journeys validated
- [ ] Performance metrics monitored
- [ ] Error rates and user feedback tracked
- [ ] Rollback procedures validated if needed
```
