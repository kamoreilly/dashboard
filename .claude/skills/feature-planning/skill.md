## Feature Planning Process

### 1. Requirements Gathering
```typescript
// Business Requirements Analysis
- Stakeholder interviews and requirement collection
- Business goal alignment and validation
- Technical constraint identification
- Resource and timeline assessment

// User Research & Analysis
- User interviews and feedback collection
- Behavior pattern analysis and identification
- Pain point identification and solution ideation
- User persona development and validation
```

### 2. Feature Definition
```typescript
// Feature Specification
- Feature scope and boundary definition
- Functional requirements and user stories
- Non-functional requirements and constraints
- Success criteria and acceptance criteria

// Technical Requirements
- Technical specifications and architecture considerations
- Integration requirements and dependencies
- Performance requirements and scalability needs
- Security requirements and compliance considerations
```

### 3. User Story Creation
```typescript
// User Story Template
As a [user type],
I want to [action/goal],
so that [benefit/value].

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [expected outcome]

Technical Requirements:
- [Technical specifications]
- [Integration requirements]
- [Performance requirements]
```

### 4. Prioritization Framework
```typescript
// Prioritization Criteria
- Business Value: Impact on business goals and user satisfaction
- User Impact: Effect on user experience and task completion
- Technical Complexity: Implementation difficulty and resource requirements
- Strategic Alignment: Consistency with product vision and roadmap
- Dependencies: Relationship with other features and initiatives

// Scoring System
- Business Value: 1-5 (Low to High)
- User Impact: 1-5 (Low to High)
- Technical Complexity: 1-5 (High to Low, inverted for complexity)
- Strategic Alignment: 1-5 (Low to High)
- Total Score: Weighted sum based on priorities
```

==========================

ðŸŽ¯ Feature: User Profile Management
---------------------------------

### Business Requirements
- Enable users to manage their profile information
- Improve user engagement and personalization
- Support user preferences and settings customization
- Ensure data privacy and security compliance

### User Stories

#### Epic: User Profile Management
**Story 1: Profile Information Updates**
As a registered user,
I want to update my personal information,
so that I can keep my profile current and accurate.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am logged into my account
- When I navigate to the profile page
- Then I can see my current profile information
- And I can edit my name, email, and bio
- And changes are saved successfully
- And I receive confirmation of successful updates

**Technical Requirements:**
- Profile update API endpoint with validation
- Form component with proper error handling
- Database schema updates for profile fields
- Email verification for email changes
- Audit logging for profile changes

**Story 2: Profile Picture Management**
As a registered user,
I want to upload and manage my profile picture,
so that I can personalize my account and improve recognition.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am on the profile page
- When I click on the profile picture
- Then I can upload a new image from my device
- And the image is cropped and resized automatically
- And I can preview the image before saving
- And the image is updated across the application

**Technical Requirements:**
- Image upload API with file validation
- Image processing and resizing service
- Cloud storage integration for images
- CDN configuration for image delivery
- Image optimization and caching strategy

### Prioritization Analysis

#### Feature Score: 4.2/5.0
- **Business Value**: 4/5 - High impact on user engagement
- **User Impact**: 4/5 - Significant improvement in user experience
- **Technical Complexity**: 3/5 - Moderate complexity with manageable risks
- **Strategic Alignment**: 5/5 - Strong alignment with personalization goals

#### Development Sequence:
1. **Sprint 1**: Profile information updates (Core functionality)
2. **Sprint 2**: Profile picture management (Enhanced functionality)
3. **Sprint 3**: Advanced profile features (Preferences, settings)

### Resource Estimation

#### Development Team:
- **Frontend Developer**: 2 weeks for UI components and forms
- **Backend Developer**: 1.5 weeks for API endpoints and validation
- **Database Engineer**: 0.5 weeks for schema updates
- **QA Engineer**: 1 week for testing and validation

#### Total Estimated Effort: 5 weeks

### Risk Assessment

#### Technical Risks:
- **Image Processing**: Complexity in handling various image formats and sizes
- **Storage Costs**: Potential increase in cloud storage costs
- **Performance**: Impact on page load times with profile images

#### Mitigation Strategies:
- Use proven image processing libraries and services
- Implement image compression and optimization
- Use CDN and caching strategies for performance
- Monitor storage usage and implement cleanup policies

### Success Metrics

#### User Engagement:
- Profile completion rate: Target 80% within 3 months
- Profile picture upload rate: Target 60% of active users
- Profile update frequency: Track user engagement with profile features

#### Technical Performance:
- Page load time: Profile page under 2 seconds
- Image upload time: Under 5 seconds for standard images
- API response time: Profile updates under 500ms

### Dependencies

#### Technical Dependencies:
- User authentication system (Complete)
- Image processing service (To be implemented)
