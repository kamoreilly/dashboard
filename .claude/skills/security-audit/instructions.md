# Security Audit Instructions

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Perform comprehensive security assessments of the JavaScript auditing application
- Check for OWASP compliance in any component
- Analyze specific security vulnerabilities or risks
- Validate security implementations before deployment
- Review authentication and authorization patterns

## How to Use

### Simple Audit Request
```
Perform a security audit of the authentication system
```

### Comprehensive Analysis
```
Conduct a full security audit of the JavaScript auditing application, focusing on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
```

### Specific Component Analysis
```
Analyze the tRPC API endpoints for security vulnerabilities and provide remediation steps
```

### Compliance Check
```
Check if our Better-Auth configuration complies with security best practices and OWASP standards
```
