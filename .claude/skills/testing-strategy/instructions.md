# Testing Strategy Instructions

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Generate comprehensive unit tests for tRPC procedures and React components
- Create integration tests for authentication flows and database operations
- Set up testing frameworks and configuration
- Analyze test coverage and identify testing gaps
- Design end-to-end testing strategies

## How to Use

### Generate Unit Tests
```
Generate unit tests for all tRPC procedures with authentication and validation testing
```

### Create Integration Tests
```
Create integration tests for authentication flows and database operations
```

### Analyze Test Coverage
```
Analyze test coverage across all packages and identify areas that need more testing
```

### Design Testing Strategy
```
Create a comprehensive testing strategy for the full-stack application
```

## What the Skill Will Do

1. **Analyze Codebase**: Examine the application structure and identify testing needs
2. **Generate Test Suites**: Create unit, integration, and E2E tests
3. **Configure Testing Tools**: Set up testing frameworks and utilities
4. **Provide Test Data**: Create fixtures and mock data for testing
5. **Generate Reports**: Create testing strategy documents and coverage reports

## Testing Categories

### Unit Testing
- Individual function testing
- Component isolation testing
- Utility function testing
- Input validation testing

### Integration Testing
- Database operation testing
- tRPC procedure integration
- Authentication flow testing
- API endpoint testing

### End-to-End Testing
- User journey testing
- Cross-package integration
- Full workflow testing
- Performance testing

## Key Testing Areas

### tRPC Testing
- Procedure input/output validation
- Authentication middleware testing
- Error handling and edge cases
- Router integration testing

### Authentication Testing
- Login/logout flows
- Session management
- OAuth provider integration
- Security validation

### Database Testing
- Schema validation
- CRUD operations
- Constraint enforcement
- Migration testing

### Frontend Testing
- Component behavior
- User interactions
- Hook functionality
- Route navigation

## Output Expectations

The skill will provide:
- Complete test suites for all application layers
- Testing configuration and setup instructions
- Test fixtures and mock data
- Coverage analysis and recommendations
- Testing strategy documentation

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what the code does, not how
2. **Maintain Test Independence**: Tests should not depend on each other
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly indicate what is being tested
4. **Cover Edge Cases**: Test error conditions and unusual scenarios
5. **Regular Testing**: Integrate testing into the development workflow

This skill ensures comprehensive test coverage and helps maintain code quality across the entire application.
